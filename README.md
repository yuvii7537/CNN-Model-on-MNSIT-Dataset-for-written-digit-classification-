I’m excited to share a key project from my internship experience — building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify handwritten digits from the widely used MNIST dataset.
✔️ Project Highlights :
 ◾ Preprocessed and explored the MNIST dataset containing 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             digits(0–9).
 ◾ Designed and trained a deep CNN architecture using TensorFlow and Keras, incorporating Batch   Normalization, Dropout, and LeakyReLU activation for improved performance.
 ◾ Achieved over 98% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating strong classification capabilities.
 ◾ Visualized training progress with accuracy and loss curves, and validated model predictions with sample digit images.
 ◾ Implemented callbacks like EarlyStopping and ModelCheckpoint to optimize training and avoid overfitting.
